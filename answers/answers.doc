1. How long did you spend on the code test?
I apent close to 2 hours. This is because I had issues creating an account on the openweather

2. What went well?
Everything except the getting the API key

3. Was there anything that was attempted but was not possible to get working in the time so is not visible in the code?
Tried to add weather images on the right side of the homepage but it's taking time

4. What would you do to improve it / continue development?
I would like to add some better design, Make all API calls from the redux rather than just using it to set the data. Also, with slow internet, I noticed the switch from metric to inperial units and vice versa is not smooth, would love to make it smoother
